Notes:
-Zombie observer and observable seems a bit broad and the observer is forced to care
both when the enemy dies in both ways. (Robert)
-Going off what rob said, your observer pattern should be focused on 1 task and 1 task only if possible(Vincent)

-Factories seem like a clean way to manage multiple types of towers

- Great idea using a strategy pattern for the movement, it really does lend itself well to the situation

- I recommend not declaring a new Point2D every time update is called on FlyMovement. Instead, just override
the values because you are currently relying on the Garbage collector to cleanup for you.

- Your projectiles seem to go astray from the way you do your factories everywhere else. You have a 
different factory for each projectile type rather than 1 that creates them all. Perhaps refactor that
to be consistent with the rest of your factories?
